# Exercism

This is the repository of my learning tracks on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). 
I thourougly enjoy learning on the platform, and I strongly recommend it!

I've started my journey on Exercism during COVID lockdown.

I've used Exercism to learn Go, Haskell and Rust, and to practice Python. I've dipped my toes
in other languages, like Julia and Scala, just for fun!
